Jaqueline Cornish:
Working with Denis on our software development team was a pleasure. His intelligence and out of the box thinking were an asset during design sessions as well as for day to day operational tasks

Souhail Alavi:
When we interviewed Denis in his 3rd year of university for a coop term, right there i realized we wanted him on the team. He was way ahead of his peers in programming knowledge. His dedication to side projects and hackatons were indicative of someone with passion for programming. He tackled some of the most complex projects with ease, go along with everyone and was a good team player. It was an honour to have denis on the team and we wish him luck in any endeavours.
