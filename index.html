			<p class="description">During my co-op term with Endako Mines in Fraser Lake, BC I mostly did research into iPhone app development and generally helped the IT department with their company website and other problems which occured.
			I created a new website from scratch using standard PHP, HTML, and CSS with no frameworks other than jQuery. The website had a slideshow, company history, and a list of open jobs in the form of PDF files uploaded to a network drive and shown on the website.
			I also created a Visual Basic app for a windows tablet computer in the mine equipment pit shop for employees to log maintenance hours on equipment.</p>
